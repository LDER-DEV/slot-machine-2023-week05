### Goal: Build a Simple Slot Machine

Tech used: HTML, CSS, JavaScript

This project was made mostly with javascript with some light html and css. The HTML has containers for the the slot machine as a whole and their reels, buttons for betting a minmum and maximum amount and a place to hold money totals. On the Javascript end there are functions for betting the minimum the maximum, each containing conditionals reffering to win conditions, as well as a function that kicks the player out if they run out of funds.

Lessons Learned:
I learned upon further studies i found a method of adding pictures in the slot machines using arrays and a foreach loop to generate the random picture values
